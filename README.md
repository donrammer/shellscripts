# shellscripts

Here are some shell scripts I have created as part of my learning to help me automate my most common every day tasks!

Content:

1) CentOS_8_Wordpress_SSL_Install.sh - Install and configure Worpress website using MariaDB and a Let's Encrypt certificate
2) CentOS_8_CheckMK_2.0_Install.sh - Install and configure CheckMK 2.0 Agent. Please note Agent needs manually copying into script directory from the CheckMK Server
