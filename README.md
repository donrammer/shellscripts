# shellscripts

Here are some shell scripts I have created as part of my learning to help me automate my most common every day tasks!

Content:

1) CentOS_8_Wordpress_SSL_Install.sh - Install and configure Worpress website, including the base applications of MariaDB and Certbot to enable HTTPS.
2) CentOS_8_CheckMK_2.0_Install.sh - Install and configure CheckMK 2.0 Agent. This script will pull the agent from your local CheckMK server after you provide the IP and port your HTTP service runs on.
